			<p>Himon Chowdhury is a student who studies bachelor of busines administration in Accounting and Information Systems in Comilla University. He was born on 30,August,1997 in Brahmanbaria. He is the 4th child of Mr. Chitta Ranjan Chowdhury and Sabita Chowdhury.Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 [31] [1][32][33] to a Maharashtrian family.[34][35] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[36] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[37][38]

			Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[39] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[40] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced the young Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy
